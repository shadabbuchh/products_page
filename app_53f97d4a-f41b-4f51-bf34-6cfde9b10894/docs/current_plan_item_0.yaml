description: 'The system shall display a searchable, sortable, and paginated list
  of all products on the Products page.

  When the user types in the search box, the system shall filter the visible products
  by name, SKU, and description.

  When the user applies filters or sorting, the system shall update the displayed
  product list and maintain the current pagination state.

  While a product''s available stock is below its low-stock threshold, the system
  shall visually highlight that product''s row to indicate low stock.

  When the user requests a product''s details, the system shall open the product details
  view without losing the current table state.

  Where inline editing is available, the system shall allow quick edits for key attributes
  directly from the table and persist changes immediately.

  When the user navigates pages in the table, the system shall show the correct subset
  of products and preserve applied filters and sort order.'
